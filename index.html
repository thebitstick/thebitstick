# TheBitStick 

Hi, My name is Jorge, and I go by **"TheBitStick"** (and sometimes **"makotoadmirer"** or **"hieisuki"**) online.
I've got knowledge in <span style="color:yellow">Python</span>, <span style="color:orange">Java</span>, <span style="color:brown">Rust</span>, and I plan on learning <span style="color:grey">C++</span> someday.
I am currently a University student and I plan to graduate with my Bachelor in Computer Science.
I code mainly as a hobby, and I don't plan on coding professionally.
This page is written using Markdown simply because I hate writing HTML.
